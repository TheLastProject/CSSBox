## CSSBox
A simple, pure-CSS Lightbox replacement.

## Why CSSBox?
* Actually lightweight (815b including comments, 519b excluding comments, unminified!)
* Centers the image with a nice, yet simple border
* Completely responsive, works on any screen size
* Has a pretty fade in animation

## Usage
Upload cssbox.css to your server and add a stylesheet link to it in your CSS.

Add your images like this:

    <img class="cssbox_thumb" tabindex=1 src="image_thumbnail.png" /><img class="cssbox_full" src="image_full.png" />

When a visitor clicks the tumbnail, the fullsize preview will appear in the
center of the screen.
